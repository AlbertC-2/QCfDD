    "\n",
    "In quantum computing, when operations are restricted solely to: a) Clifford group gates, b) measurements of Pauli group operators, and c) Clifford group operations conditioned on classical bits, potentially derived from prior measurements, it is possible to achieve perfect simulation using a probabilistic classical computer within polynomial time. This insight naturally leads us to contemplate the prospect of simulating the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) process efficiently in a noise-free environment, thereby obtaining exceptional initialization parameters. These parameters, in turn, can be harnessed for executing VQE on a quantum computer.\n",

In the noise-free simulation phase, our exploration is confined to the Clifford space, facilitating the rapid acquisition of high-quality parameters within polynomial time.

    "## Weight-Aware Quantum Resource Allocation Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance the quantum resource utilization efficiency of our program, we have devised and implemented a resource allocation strategy grounded in the weights (coefficients) associated with the expectations of Pauli strings during energy computation. Given that all Pauli strings exhibit similar circuit depths (and qubit counts), we gauge quantum resource allocation by measuring the execution shots required for a quantum circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "As depicted below, due to the substantial variations in weights among different Pauli strings, it is impractical to distribute quantum computing shots uniformly across all Pauli strings. An intuitive approach involves allocating more shots to Pauli strings with higher weights (e.g., `\"IZIIIIIIIIII\"`), and inversely so.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize our resource allocation to the highest degree possible, we undertake a thorough theoretical and quantitative analysis, as outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawing from the central limit theorem, we can infer that the mean error $e_i$ associated with measuring string $P_i$ for $N_i$ shots is proportional to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_i}}$. Considering the formula $Energy=\\sum_i Expectation_i \\times coefficient_i$, our goal is to ensure that every term exhibits errors on a similar scale. To achieve this, we endeavor to satisfy the condition: $coefficient_i \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_i}}=const$ for every term $i$. Consequently, we derive an optimally theoretical shot allocation approach: let $N_i=\\left\\lfloor k\\times coefficient_i^2\\right\\rfloor$, where k is a global constant.\n",

    "## Pauli String Grouping (Partition) Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main methods proposed to suppress an increase in the number of measurements is the partitioning (grouping) method, where Pauli strings are partitioned so that their expectation values can be measured simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, a group of Pauli strings is divided into subgroups, and all the components of each subgroup are measured simultaneously using only one circuit (hereafter, such subgroups are called “partitions”). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A simultaneous measurement is based on the fact that the expectation values of two Pauli strings $𝑃_1$ and $𝑃_2$ can be simultaneously estimated by applying an appropriate basis-changing operation if and only if they commute each other (i.e., $𝑃_1𝑃_2 = 𝑃_2𝑃_1$)\n",
    "\n",
    "To maximize the effectiveness of simultaneous measurement, the number of partitions should be minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure shows a scheme for measuring the expectation values of multiple Pauli strings using simultaneous measurement and partitioning. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/grouping.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After enumerating the Pauli strings that are required to estimate the expectation values (step (1)), the commutativity of each pair of Pauli strings was checked (step (2)). Then, we created partitions where all Pauli strings commute (step (3)). Based on this, we determined the basis-changing gate B for each partition (step (4)), and finally, all the expectation values of the Pauli strings were estimated (step (5)). Using steps (2) and (3) presented in Figure 1, the number of circuits was reduced to the number of partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of Pauli string grouping can be broken down into two parts:\n",
    "1. The partition of a given group of Pauli strings.\n",
    "2. The method to get the equivalent measurement results of pauli strings in a partition from the result of the so-called \"simultaneous measurement\" \n",
    "\n",
    "We solve the first part (the partition) of the problem by calling the method in the `qiskit.Estimator`, and we tackle the second part (simultaneous measurement) by using the functions: `get_pauli_expectations`, `count_to_exps`, `get_group_exp`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the streamlined workflow for our simultaneous measurement process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The measurement result on the Pauli string (e.g., `\"ZZZZZZZZZZZZ\"`) and the accompanying data pertaining to the corresponding Pauli string group (e.g., `['IIIIIIIIIIII', 'IZIIIIIIIIII', ...]`) are transmitted to the `count_to_exps` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Within the `count_to_exps` function, the aforementioned measurement result, along with each Pauli string in the group (partition), is supplied to the `get_ground_exp` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the `get_ground_exp` function, computations are performed to derive the corresponding equivalent measurement result from the original measurement outcome. Furthermore, the expectation value of the Pauli string is computed and, if applicable, mitigated when the rem mitigator is not None. "

    "- The \"zne.foldall\" noise scale function is employed for local unitary gate folding, known for its substantial stability and resilience in the face of noise. This method strikes a well-balanced compromise between accuracy and computational speed, particularly when scale factors are set to `[1, 3, 5]` and the Richardson extrapolation method is applied. This particular combination is most suitable for backends characterized by low noise levels, such as the Montreal backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In contrast, both the Cairo and Kolkata backends exhibit relatively high noise levels. In such scenarios, utilizing the noise scale functions \"zne.fold_global\" in conjunction with scale factors of `[1, 2, 3]` enhances sensitivity to variations in the noise scale of quantum circuits. Consequently, this combination yields superior error mitigation performance in noisy backends, with the added stability of the Linear extrapolation method ensuring consistent results."
